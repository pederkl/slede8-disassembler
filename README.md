# Slede8 disassembler

## What is this?

Slede8 is a toy 8-bit computer architecture used in a Norwegian CTF
advent calendar.  See https://github.com/PSTNorge/slede8 and
https://slede8.npst.no/

The emulator at https://slede8.npst.no/ can assemble code to binary
files, but it can't load the binaries.  Some tasks in the advent
calendar supplied a binary file, and it would be useful to see the
original program.  So I made this.
